yet another test job

Download the front page HTML file of www.meetangee.com, scan it as fast as you can and download every file the page references. These files must be downloaded as fast as possible, so download them in parallel. Make hash of every file with Adler 32 algorithm. Print list of file names and their hashes to the command line. Highlight the biggest and smallest (in size) file.

Pavel must work, and will be judged, on which algorithms, libraries he uses, on code structure and documentation (must be in English). He can use any information source he wishes and take as much time as need. The program must be developed in C++ (using OOP style) and must run on Ubuntu 16.04. He can also use any library in Ubuntu 16.04 repository if it helps. For compilation he can use any command line tool (i.e. no Eclipse project...) or command. He is not allowed to use any external programs during execution of his application. Write the interface of his code so it could be reused in some other program.

To compile the test task code on Ubuntu 16.04, install some additional packages running the following command:
sudo apt-get install g++ libcurl4-openssl-dev libcrypto++-dev
